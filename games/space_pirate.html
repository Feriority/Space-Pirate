                <p>
                You almost think you recognize the woman running for the escape
                pod, but before it clicks, the deck shakes violently again.  The
                woman stumbles, you nearly lose your footing, and it occurs to
                you that you, too, should <a href='dreams-2'>run to the escape pod</a>.
                It's the last one in this area - most of the crew is already gone.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="dreams-2">
                <p>
                The woman - who IS she? - makes it to the pod before you.  You
                run as fast as you can to catch up, but seconds before you reach
                your last chance to escape, you hear the hiss of the door closing.
                In the moment it takes to shut, you can see her mouth "sorry".
                </p>

                <p>
                Then the moment is gone and the door slams closed with a bang.
                You're not going to make it off the station - but you laugh, as
                you recognize that last expression, and you <a href='wake-up'>remember...</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="wake-up">
                <h1>The Spyglass</h1>
                <p>
                As you groggily get up, the dream slips away.  You recall
                something about a station, and there was someone else there?
                </p>

                <p>
                "-up!  We're on approach to the station now.  The salvage team
                isn't here yet - if we're quick, we can grab something good
                before they show up."  Your little ship might be held together
                by duct tape and string, but the experimental AI you... liberated,
                *Caliburn, has turned out to be a godsend.  When it isn't ruining
                your attempts to get some sleep, anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                Well, you'd better get ready, if you're about to dock.  Your gear
                gives you some protection from the environmental hazards of a derelict
                space station - most notably, the lack of breathable air you'll
                almostly certainly encounter.  Naturally, you also reach for...

                    <ul class='options'>

            </div>

            <div id="get-gun">
                <p>
                your gun, obviously.  Sure, parts of the station might be exposed
                to vacuum, but not all of it is, and you don't know what happened
                to it in the first place.  Do you really want to go in there
                unarmed?
                <p>
            </div>

            <div id="get-tools">
                <p>
                your tools, obviously.  Yeah, there'll be some stuff you can just
                walk out with, but having the right tools gives you a lot more
                options.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="leave-ship">
                <p>
                As you equip yourself, the Spyglass is pulling up to the station.
                Your AI has found a good spot to get you through the hull.  All
                that's left is to  <a href='board-station'>put on your helmet
                and get to the station.</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="board-station">
                <p>
                In addition to giving you feedback on your suit's condition,
                the helmet's HUD shows you some navigation information and
                allows you to communicate with *Caliburn while away from your
                ship.
                </p>

                <p>
                The station is a rotating ring around a central spire.  This
                gives some natural references for navigation - moving along
                with the station is turnwise, and moving against it is
                anti-turnwise.  You can also move radially in - hubward - or out
                - rimward.
                </p>

                <h1>Artosis Station</h1>
                <p>
                You enter the station through a breach in the hull.  Some of the
                interior bulkheads have been blown out, but others are locked down
                from the station's attempt to contain the damage during evacuation,
                which will limit your ability to move around the station unless
                you can find a way to deal with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                You find yourself in a residential area of the station.  There
                are a number of cabins nearby, which are easy enough for you to
                break into; you look for anything worth looting, but the real
                valuables are going to be elsewhere in the station, and you don't
                find anything worth taking.  There are also doors turnwise and
                anti-turnwise to other parts of the station.
                </p>

                You're in the residential area you used to enter the station.
                The Spyglass is anchored to the station's hull outside a breach.
                There are a number of cabins, which you have already searched.  There
                are doors turnwise and anti-turnwise to other parts of the station.

            <div id="station-offduty">
                <p>
                This part of the station was largely for off-duty crew - the mess
                hall, a large recreation area, and some areas for relaxation.  A
                map on the wall suggests there was a library where there is now a
                sealed bulkhead and a large hole.  There should be storage areas
                here, exactly what you were looking for, but a breach in one of
                them and a blown out bulkhead have caused the path to them to be
                locked down.  You think you can see a way to
                <a href='station-rec'>one of the gyms</a>, and the map shows a
                <a href='./spire'>path to the central spire</a>.  The
