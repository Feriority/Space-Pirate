                <p>
                You almost think you recognize the woman running for the escape
                pod, but before it clicks, the deck shakes violently again.  The
                woman stumbles, you nearly lose your footing, and it occurs to
                you that you, too, should <a href='dreams-2'>run to the escape pod</a>.
                It's the last one in this area - most of the crew is already gone.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="dreams-2">
                <p>
                The woman - who IS she? - makes it to the pod before you.  You
                run as fast as you can to catch up, but seconds before you reach
                your last chance to escape, you hear the hiss of the door closing.
                In the moment it takes to shut, you can see her mouth "sorry".
                </p>

                <p>
                Then the moment is gone and the door slams closed with a bang.
                You're not going to make it off the station - but you laugh, as
                you recognize that last expression, and you <a href='wake-up'>remember...</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="wake-up">
                <h1>The Spyglass</h1>
                <p>
                As you groggily get up, the dream slips away.  You recall
                something about a station, and there was someone else there?
                </p>

                <p>
                "-up!  We're on approach to the station now.  The salvage team
                isn't here yet - if we're quick, we can grab something good
                before they show up."  Your little ship might be held together
                by duct tape and string, but the experimental AI you... liberated,
                *Caliburn, has turned out to be a godsend.  When it isn't ruining
                your attempts to get some sleep, anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                Well, you'd better get ready, if you're about to dock.  Your gear
                gives you some protection from the environmental hazards of a derelict
                space station - most notably, the lack of breathable air you'll
                almostly certainly encounter.  Naturally, you also reach for...

                    <ul class='options'>
                        <li><a href='get-gun'>your weapon - it could be dangerous.</a></li>
                        <li><a href='get-tools'>your tools - how else are you going to loot the ship?</a></li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

            <div id="get-gun">
                <p>
                your gun, obviously.  Sure, parts of the station might be exposed
                to vacuum, but not all of it is, and you don't know what happened
                to it in the first place.  Do you really want to go in there
                unarmed?
                <p>
            </div>

            <div id="get-tools">
                <p>
                your tools, obviously.  Yeah, there'll be some stuff you can just
                walk out with, but having the right tools gives you a lot more
                options.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="leave-ship">
                <p>
                As you equip yourself, the Spyglass is pulling up to the station.
                Your AI has found a good spot to get you through the hull.  All
                that's left is to  <a href='board-station'>put on your helmet
                and get to the station.</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="board-station">
                <p>
                In addition to giving you feedback on your suit's condition,
                the helmet's HUD shows you some navigation information and
                allows you to communicate with *Caliburn while away from your
                ship.
                </p>

                <p>
                The station is a rotating ring around a central spire.  This
                gives some natural references for navigation - moving along
                with the station is turnwise, and moving against it is
                anti-turnwise.  The floor is the outer wall of the ring, to
                take advantage of the simulated gravity the rotation creates.
                </p>

                <h1>Artosis Station</h1>
                <p>
                You enter the station through a breach in the hull.  Some of the
                interior bulkheads have been blown out, but others are locked down
                from the station's attempt to contain the damage during evacuation,
                which will limit your ability to move around the station unless
                you can find a way to deal with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                You find yourself in a residential area of the station.  There
                are a number of cabins nearby, which are easy enough for you to
                break into; you look for anything worth looting, but the real
                valuables are going to be elsewhere in the station, and you don't
                find anything worth taking.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="station-entrance-desc">
                <p>
                You're in the residential area you used to enter the station.
                The Spyglass is anchored to the station's hull outside a breach.
                There are a number of cabins, which you have already searched.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="station-entrance" class='transient'>
                <p>
                There are doors turnwise and anti-turnwise to other parts of
                the station.  According to your map, they lead to
                <a href='station-offduty'>an off-duty area</a> and
                <a href='station-work'>the main labs</a>, respectively.
            </div>

            <!-- Off duty -->
            <div id="station-offduty">
                <p>
                This part of the station was largely for off-duty crew - the mess
                hall, a large recreation area, and some areas for relaxation.  A
                map on the wall suggests there was a library where there is now a
                sealed bulkhead and a large hole.  There should be storage areas
                here, exactly what you were looking for, but a breach in one of
                them and a blown out bulkhead have caused the path to them to be
                locked down.  You think you can see a way to
                <a href='station-rec'>one of the gyms</a>, and the map shows a
                <a href='./spire'>path to the central spire</a>.  The
                <a href='./command'>command deck</a> should be turnwise from here.
                </p>

                <p>
                You can also <a href='station-entrance'>go back</a> to the entrance.
                </p>

            <!-- Work -->
            <div id="station-work">
                <p>
                This part of the station was where the crew worked.  Most
                of it is lab space, but you don't have the time to move
                the heavy equipment that would be most valuable; you'll
                have to settle for the various samples and small things
                you grabbed during a quick pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                The map on the wall shows <a href='station-medbay'>a medbay</a>,
                a <a href='station-security'>security office</a>, and a
                <a href='./spire'>path to the central spire</a>.  The

                <p>
                With the security systems disabled, you find it easy to make it
                into the security offices.  Whatever happened here, they got hit
                pretty badly - the area is mostly destroyed.  Strangely, some of
                the blown out walls seem to have been destroyed from the inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                Normally, this would be a great location to loot, but the armory
                seems to have been lost to the vacuum.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Command and spire -->
            <div id='station-command'>
                <p>
                You make your way through the command deck slowly and carefully.
                Rubble is everywhere, but oddly the hull doesn't appear to have
                been breached anywhere in this section of the station; it's just
                the interior structures that have been blasted apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                A large, transparent section of the hull allows you to see the
                planet spinning below.  The view is amazing; for a moment, you
                remember exactly why you decided to spend your life as a spacer
                instead of settling down on some station or colony.  There's some
                sort of storm raging below; it must be huge, to be visible from
                orbit, and the whirling red and purple clouds are a fantastic sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                You try to reach the actual station controls and communication systems,
                but they're completely inaccessible.  You can, however, access the
                overrides to the doors that lead turnwise and anti-turnwise, which
                should give you a clear path around the entire loop of the station.

                <p>
                There is another <a href='./spire'>path to the spire</a> from this
                deck.  You can also go turnwise to <a href='station-work'>the main labs</a>
                or anti-turnwise to <a href='station-offduty'>the off-duty area</a>.
                </p>

                This path to the spire, at least, is totally clear of rubble.  You
                find a gate blocking off the elevator into the core of the station,
                however - the warnings indicate that the spire labs are high security,
                and under lockdown.  There's also various safety warnings about the
                shifting gravity along the elevator path, and the low-gravity spire.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id='station-spire'>
                <p>
                The elevator to the spire is unpowered; you have to climb a ladder up
                an emergency shaft.  It's long, but the gravity drops off as you climb,
                so it's an easier trip than it looks.  You're practically flying at the
                end of the climb, pushing off the ladder to move up the shaft.
                </p>
                <p>
                There's a second sealed door at the top of the shaft, but your security
                card unlocks it.  You float through, and find yourself in another lab.
                This one is a wreck; the spire walls are perforated, despite looking a
                a lot sturdier than the ring walls were.  Most of the equipment is in
                ruins.
                </p>
                <p>
                "Hey, boss?"  *Caliburn cuts through.  "We've got movement at the outer
                comm buoy.  I hope you've found something good, because we need to get
                out of here fast."
                </p>
                <p>
                You don't have much time, but your findings have been pretty meager so
                far - you should at least search this lab before you leave.  It's what
                it looked like, all wreckage - but then you move what's left of a door
                aside, and find a brilliant glowing ball, floating in place.  It's
                surface is covered in violently shifting reds and purples like the storm
                you saw on the planet below.
                </p>
                <p>
                You consider trying to grab the orb, but something about it feels wrong.
                It would be smarter to leave it alone and <a href='./stop'>go back</a>.

                You don't really remember how you made it back to the Spyglass, but you
                get aboard in time and detach the ship from Artosis Station's hull.
                By the time you're ready to leave, you can already see the Euryphaessa
                approaching.  It's a huge warship - not what you'd expect to see here
                at all.  You briefly wonder why it's here, but know better than to stick
                around to find out - you get out of there, quick.
                </p>
                <p>
                As you jump out of the system, you get the feeling you've forgotten
                about something important...
