                <p>
                You almost think you recognize the woman running for the escape
                pod, but before it clicks, the deck shakes violently again.  As the
                running woman stumbles, you nearly lose your footing, and it occurs to
                you that you, too, should <a href='dreams-2'>run to the escape pod</a>.
                It's the last one in this part of the station, and you won't have
                time to make it to one of the other decks.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="dreams-2">
                <p>
                The woman - who IS she? - makes it to the pod before you.  You're
                running as fast as you can, but seconds before you reach the pod,
                you hear the hiss of the door starting to close, and see her mouth
                "sorry".
                </p>

                <p>
                You dive for the door, but it's too late - the door slams closed
                with a bang.  You're not going to make it off the station - but
                despite the situation, you laugh softly, as you recognize the
                pained expression on her face as the door closed, and
                <a href='wake-up'>remember...</a>.

                <h1>The <em>Spyglass</em></h1>
                <p>
                You slowly open your eyes to the sound of someone's voice. As you
                groggily sit up, the dream slips away.  There was a station, and
                there was... someone else there?
                </p>

                <p>
                "-up!  We're on approach to Artosis Station now.  The official
                salvage team has already been dispatched.  You'll need to work
                quickly if you're going to get anything of value."  *Caliburn's
                voice crackles from the speakers in your room as you
                <a href="get-up">get out of bed</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
                
            <div id="get-up">
                <p>
                Your ship, the <em>Spyglass</em>, is a small transport craft
                you've converted mostly into storage space for smuggling, with
                just enough room for you to live comfortably.  It might be held
                together by duct tape and nanowire, but *Caliburn, the experimental
                AI you... liberated from a research lab on Klein, has turned out
                to be a godsend.  When it isn't ruining your attempts to get some
                sleep, anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                It can pilot, manage the ship's systems, help make plans, and has
                a lot more personality than a run-of-the-mill shipboard AI, though
                that comes with a few quirks (like its insistence on the star in
                its name, an outdated AI naming convention that nobody pronounces
                anyway.)
                </p>

                <p>
                You stop reminiscing about that job - the important thing is that
                *Caliburn is working with you now.  "We'll be docking shortly.
                I would recommend that you <a href="get-ready">get ready</a>,
                unless you've learned to breathe in hard vacuum."  Well, maybe it
                has a little too much personality.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="get-ready">
                <p>
                You slip into your spacesuit like you've done a thousand times before.
                It gives you some protection from the environmental hazards of a
                derelict space station - most notably, the lack of breathable air
                you'll almost certainly encounter, but it also regulates temperature
                well enough to handle most of what you could run into, and even
                cushions a little against heavy impacts, which has saved your life
                before.
                </p>

                <p>
                Once you've got the suit on, you lock the helmet in place.
                Diagnostics flash across your visor as its HUD boots up and tests
                your suit, then a handful of condition monitors - for you and the
                suit - appear in a corner, out of the way of your vision.
                </p>

                <p>
                "I'm uploading a map of the station to your HUD."  *Caliburn's
                voice comes over the speakers in your helmet, rather than from
                the ship; the helmet should allow you to communicate with him as
                you explore the station.  The map blinks in front of you, then
                hides itself in another corner of your view.
                </p>

                the same loot you did, and you were lucky to get away with your
                life.  Since then, you've gotten very good with your pistol - it's
                powerful enough to make a difference, but small enough that it
                doesn't slow you down or get in your way, and it's easy to hide.

                have a variety of useful gadgets, collected over the years, and

                As you equip yourself, the <em>Spyglass</em> is pulling up to the
                station, a rotating ring around a central spire - a common design
                for old stations, or newer ones being built cheaply.  The outer
                wall becomes the floor, using the station's rotation to simulate
                gravity.  Sections of the ring's wall are crumpled, and others
                are missing entirely.  It's surprising that the station is still
                spinning, or holding up as well as it is, considering the
                structural damage.

                "Docking the ship now.  Brace for impact."  The <em>Spyglass</em>

                You enter the station through a breach in the hull.  Some of the
                interior bulkheads have been blown out, but others are locked down
                from the station's attempt to contain the damage during evacuation,
                which will limit your ability to move around the station unless
                you can find a way to deal with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                "I'm annotating your map with directions.  The spinning of the

                <p>
                You find yourself in a residential area of the station.  There
                are a number of cabins nearby, which are easy enough for you to
                break into; you look for anything worth looting, but the real
                valuables are going to be elsewhere in the station, and you don't
                find anything worth taking.

                This part of the station was largely for off-duty crew - the mess
                hall, a large recreation area, and some areas for relaxation.
                Your map suggests there was a library where there is now a
                sealed bulkhead and a large hole.  There should be storage areas
                here, exactly what you were looking for, but a breach in one of
                them and a blown out bulkhead have caused the path to them to be
                locked down.  You think you can see a way to
                <a href='station-rec'>one of the gyms</a>, and the map shows a

                The gym is in pretty bad shape, and it's not like you're going to
                steal broken exercise equipment.  Still, you take a quick look
                around.
                </p>

            <!-- Work -->

                <p>
                This part of the station was where the crew worked.  Most
                of it is lab space, but you don't have the time to move
                the heavy equipment that would be most valuable; you'll
                have to settle for the various samples and small things
                you grabbed during a quick pass.

                Your map shows <a href='station-medbay'>a medbay</a>,
                a <a href='station-security'>security office</a>, and a
                <a href='./spire'>path to the central spire</a>.  The
                <a href='./command'>command deck</a> should be anti-turnwise
                from here.

                The station's medbay is well equipped - the small research team
                here had to be self-sufficient for long periods at a time.  You
                wish you could take some of the larger equipment back with you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="station-security-inside">
                <p>
                With the security systems disabled, you find it easy to make it
                into the security offices.  Whatever happened here, they got hit
                pretty badly - the area is mostly destroyed.  Strangely, some of
                the blown out walls seem to have been destroyed from the inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                Normally, this would be a great location to loot, but the armory
                seems to have been lost to the vacuum.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Command and spire -->
            <div id='station-command'>
                <p>
                You make your way through the command deck slowly and carefully.
                Rubble is everywhere, but oddly the hull doesn't appear to have
                been breached anywhere in this section of the station; it's just
                the interior structures that have been blasted apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                A large, transparent section of the hull allows you to see the
                planet spinning below.  The view is amazing; for a moment, you
                remember exactly why you decided to spend your life exploring space
                instead of settling down on some station or colony.  There's some
                sort of storm raging below; it must be huge, to be visible from
                orbit, and the whirling red and purple clouds are a fantastic sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                You try to reach the actual station controls and communication systems,
                but they're completely inaccessible.  You can, however, access the
                overrides to the doors that lead turnwise and anti-turnwise, which
                should give you a clear path around the entire loop of the station.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id='station-command-nav'>
                <p>
                There is another <a href='./spire'>path to the spire</a> from this
                deck.  You can also go turnwise to <a href='station-work'>the main labs</a>
                or anti-turnwise to <a href='station-offduty'>the off-duty area</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id='station-spire-security'>
                <p>
                This path to the spire, at least, is totally clear of rubble.  You
                find a gate blocking off the elevator into the core of the station,
                however - the warnings indicate that the spire labs are high security,
                and under lockdown.  There's also various safety warnings about the
                shifting gravity along the elevator path, and the low-gravity spire.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id='station-spire'>
                <p>
                The elevator to the spire is unpowered; you have to climb a ladder up
                an emergency shaft.  It's long, but the gravity drops off as you climb,
                so it's an easier trip than it looks.  You're practically flying at the
                end of the climb, pushing off the ladder to move up the shaft.
                </p>
                <p>
                There's a second sealed door at the top of the shaft, but your security
                card unlocks it.  You float through, and find yourself in another lab.
                This one is a wreck; the spire walls are perforated, despite looking a
                a lot sturdier than the ring walls were.  Most of the equipment is in
                ruins.
                </p>
                <p>
                "Hey, boss?"  *Caliburn cuts through.  "We've got movement at the outer
                comm buoy.  I hope you've found something good, because we need to get
                out of here fast."
                </p>
                <p>
                You don't have much time, but your findings have been pretty meager so
                far - you should at least search this lab before you leave.  It's what
                it looked like, all wreckage - but then you move what's left of a door
                aside, and find a brilliant glowing ball, floating in place.  It's
                surface is covered in violently shifting reds and purples like the storm
                you saw on the planet below.
                </p>
                <p>
                You consider trying to grab the orb, but something about it feels wrong.
                It would be smarter to leave it alone and <a href='./stop'>go back</a>.
                </p>

            <!-- Escape -->
            <div id='escape'>
                <p>
                You don't really remember how you made it back to the Spyglass, but you
                get aboard in time and detach the ship from Artosis Station's hull.
                By the time you're ready to leave, you can already see the Euryphaessa
                approaching.  It's a huge warship - not what you'd expect to see here
                at all.  You briefly wonder why it's here, but know better than to stick
                around to find out - you get out of there, quick.
                </p>
                <p>
                As you jump out of the system, you get the feeling you've forgotten
                about something important...
